# Example

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/noahtren/graph-simple)](https://repl.it/github/noahtren/graph-simple)

Some *getting-started* examples.

## Simple

A simple use case with an editor in the center and a menu bar on the left side.
This example is such simple that it doesn't use redux or flux either.

Try the live demo [here](https://lochbrunner.github.io/react-flow-editor/simple/).

## Redux

Coming soon.
